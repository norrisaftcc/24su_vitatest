# 24su_vitatest
VITA Test repo summer 24

panel test
How to run the file: cd to where the unzipped file is
Open the command line and run the following command: 

panel serve python_test.py

If you want to be able to make changes to the file and have them show in the browser without having to stop and re-start the server, add the command --autoreload to the end of the command.

There is a to_Do text file included that lists the current tasks that are most important to finish before the demo.

Steps to do next:
- add a requirements.txt
- add install instructions

what we did:
pip install panel
panel serve python_test.py
pip install pyautogen
pip install openai

finally...
panel serve python_test.py
